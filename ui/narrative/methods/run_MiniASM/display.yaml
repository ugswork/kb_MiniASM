    This is a KBase wrapper for
    <https://github.com/lh3/miniasm" target="_blank">MiniASM</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    MiniASM is an ultra-fast overlap-layout-consensus based de novo assembler for noisy long reads
    developed by Heng Li. It has been shown to assemble ~50X microbial PacBio reads into a draft assembly
    of a small number of (sometimes 1) contigs in a matter of minutes. MiniASM derives this performance
    from a locality-sensitive hashing based overlapper implemented in minimap.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Known limitations:</b>  MiniASM does not support short Illumina reads.
    MiniASM is still in early development stage, and has only been tested on a dozen of PacBio and Oxford
    Nanopore bacterial data sets. The consensus sequence computed by MiniASM may not be as accurate
    as slower and more mature methods such as HGAP3.
    </p>
    <b>Parameters:</b>
    <pre>
    Usage: miniasm [options]
    Options:
      Pre-selection:

        -m INT      min match length [100]
        -i FLOAT    min identity [0.05]
        -s INT      min span [2000]
        -c INT      min coverage [3]
      Overlap:
        -o INT      min overlap [same as -s]
        -h INT      max over hang length [1000]
        -I FLOAT    min end-to-end match ratio [0.8]
      Layout:
        -g INT      max gap differences between reads for trans-reduction [1000]
        -d INT      max distance for bubble popping [50000]
        -e INT      small unitig threshold [4]
        -f FILE     read sequences []
        -n INT      rounds of short overlap removal [3]
        -r FLOAT[,FLOAT]
                    max and min overlap drop ratio [0.7,0.5]
        -F FLOAT    aggressive overlap drop ratio in the end [0.8]
      Miscellaneous:
        -p STR      output information: bed, paf, sg or ug [ug]
        -b          both directions of an arc are present in input
        -1          skip 1-pass read selection
        -2          skip 2-pass read selection
        -V          print version number
