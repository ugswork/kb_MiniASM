This directory should contain scripts and files needed to test your module's code.
 
Sample client tests in Python, Perl, and Java have been provided and may be run
using their respective client test files. Optionally, all tests can be run with
the `run_all_client_tests.sh` script. Note that these require your module's 
server code to be running.

Note that this assembler takes a large amount of memory.
The PacbioCCS tests will not complete unless on 20GB plus docker instance.
The tests take over 4hours on docker01
